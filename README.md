# COVID-19 IDENTIFICATION USING X-RAY/CT SCAN IMAGES USING CNN
- The challenge is aimed at making use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in interpreting whether the patients can be identified for COVID-19 using X_ray/ CT scan
- The projects aims in bringing up a strong algorithm that can predict the presence of COVID-19 infection The dataset can be collected from any publicly made available dataset.
## Problem description:
- The user should be able to provide an interface to select the image and load it and the machine learning prediction should be able to provide a percentage score for the chances of COVID.
- The system should be able to mark the region of interest.
- The problem is to find the effectiveness of MACHINE LEARNING in the field of medical image processing.
## Tools/Packages to be used:
- Python
- Tensorflow or any python packages for deep learning like PyTorch Can use Google COLAB
## Expected output:
- Solution should be to prove the effectiveness of Machine Learning
- The team is expected to build a good deep learning algorithm in this project
- Good accuracy score
- Should explain the steps such are preprocessing that is done
- User interface to input and select the data
